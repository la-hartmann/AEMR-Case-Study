<b> Context</b> 

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the United States of America’s domestic energy network. The regulator’s responsibility is to ensure that America’s energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions, which are known as outages.

Recently, the AEMR management team has been increasingly aware of a large number of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017 calendar years. The management team has expressed a desire to have the following two areas of concern addressed:

A) Energy Stability and Market Outages

B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability
